# ExMAS-plotting

We conducted the experiment based on actual trip requests in New York City from 2016. The whole dataset comprises half a year of consistent data (24h/day). We divided the dataset into half hour batches. Each batch constitutes a separate demand structure (set of requests). Number of requests varies from 1 up to 315.

All parameters are assumed constant during the analysis. To mention the few most important, we assume 
- the value of time to be 12.6 $/h; 
- price of 1.5 $/km; 
- willingness to share at level 1.3. 

The discount level for ride-pooling is 0.32.
